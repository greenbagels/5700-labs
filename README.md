# 5700 lab3

A collection of programs used for averaging and fitting data in OSU's Physics
5700 course offered in Spring 2021.

# Prerequisites

You need a handful of things to build the applications in this project:

- A C11 compliant compiler (for `gen_avgs`)
- A C++11 compliant compiler (for `gen_fits`)
- The GNU Scientific Library (`libgsl`) (for `gen_fits`)
- `make` (for easy building)

# Building

There's three main build targets you can specify via `make`:

- The `gen_avgs` target builds an application to perform averaging of oscilloscope
output data in the .csv format outputted by the BitScope DSO software
- The `gen_fits` target builds an application to calculate sinusoidal fits of the
data generated by `gen_avgs`, and output estimates of the relative amplitudes and
phases of the `CH_B` signal with respect to the `CH_A` signal.
